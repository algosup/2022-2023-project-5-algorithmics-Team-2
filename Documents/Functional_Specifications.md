# 1. Introduction - Overview
The software will assist the Cellar Master and her team in blending the different still wines to create a consistent flavor profile for the Krug Grande CuvÃ©e. The software will optimize the blending process to ensure that the final product is as close as possible to the desired formula, using the minimum number of steps, and without any waste.
More detaily tanks will be used to mix different wines with no thank been partialy filled, so as to get the desired flavor at a precise percentage.

##### Who is Krug ?
Here is a small brief history of Krugs.
Joseph Krug founded the House of Krug in 1843. He was born in 1800, at a time when the city was part of the Napoleonic Empire. He left Mainz in 1824 and by 1834 he was in Paris.Joseph joined Champagne Jacquesson in ChÃ¢lons-sur-Marne.
Joseph died in 1866 and was succeeded by his son Paul Krug. Joseph had laid the foundations and under the supervision of Paul. By the 1880s the prestige of Krug was acknowledged in the United Kingdom.
After Paul's death in 1910, he was succeeded by his son, Joseph Krug II. However, during World War I Joseph II was taken prisoner and his wife Jeanne played a key role in the House. After the war, Joseph II's slow recovery led to his nephew Jean Seydoux becoming joint manager in 1924. 
In 1959 to 1977, Paul Krug II, the son of Joseph II, succeeded his father. His father died in 1967.In 1962 Henri Krug, the son of Paul II, joined the management, as did his brother Remi three years later. In January 1999 the House became part of LVMH[^1] and by 2007. In 2009 Olivier Krug, the son of Henri, became House director.

# 2. Objective

Blending[^2]: 
1. Create an algorithm that make use of several tanks to blend different varities of wines and comes out with the desire flavor.
2. Implement a user interface that allows the user to input information on the different wines as well as specify the desired flavor profile for the blended wine, and displays the resulting blend and flavor profile.
   
The Krug champagne need this software so as to chose the best path way to know in which tank a particular wine have to go into during blending and to finally have the desired flavor. To have a good result, the following steps under must be taken in to consideration.
  - Correctness: no crash, no half full or half empty tanks.
  - How close your final product is from the input formula. 
  - Minimum number of steps to get to the result.
  - Speed of the code.
  - Comments and idiomatic style.

# 4. Use case

# 5. Blending step

 1. Gather data on the different vineyards and grape varieties that will be used in the blend.
 2. Create a user interface that allows the user to input information on the different wines and vineyards profile for the blended wine. The interface might include features such as dropdown menus, sliders, and other interactive elements to make it easy for the user to customize the blend.
   For example:
   (input --> percatage of wine.
   input --> quantity of wine.
   input --> index[^3] of wine.)[^4]
 3. Implement a database that can store information on the different wines and vineyards, as well as track the inventory of the individual wines and the blending process itself. This database might include tables for storing data on the grape varieties, vineyards, and individual wines.
 4. Develop a testing framework that can validate the consistency of the blended wine over time.
 5. Once the system has been developed and tested, it can be used to blend individual batches of wine to create a consistent flavor profile over time. The user can input                                                                           
information on the individual wines and vineyard and the system will generate a customized blend based on the algorithm and database.

# 6. Functionalities 
The system will be used to blend individual batches of wine to create a consistent flavor profile over time.
The information on the individual wines and vineyard, and the system will generate a customized blend based on the algorithm and database.
  - Add as much as wine you want so the formula.
  - Add as much as tank you want.
  - No half-full.
  - The error margin.

# 7. User interface
The programmes will be running on both Windows and MacOS.

# 8. Evaluation criteria

Here are the criteria that will be used to evaluate the software:

1. Correctness: no crash, no half full or half empty tanks
2. How close your final product is from the input formula
3. Comments and idiomatic style
4. Minimum number of steps to get to the result
5. Speed of the code

# 10. Conclusion

Overall, the goal of the project is to create a system that can produce high-quality blended wines with a consistent flavor profile, while also allowing for customization and flexibility based on user input.
