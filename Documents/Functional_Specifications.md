### 1. Introduction

The software will assist the Cellar Master and their team in blending the different still wines to create a consistent flavor profile for the Krug Grande CuvÃ©e. The software will optimize the blending process to ensure that the final product is as close as possible to the desired formula using the minimum number of steps and without any waste.
In order to achieve the satisfactory mix, tanks will be used to mix different wines with the requirement that tanks should be either full or empty, no in-between.

#### Who is Krug ?

Here is a small brief history of Krugs.
Joseph Krug founded the House of Krug in 1843. He was born in 1800, at a time when the city was part of the Napoleonic Empire. He left Mainz in 1824 and by 1834 he was in Paris.Joseph joined Champagne Jacquesson in ChÃ¢lons-sur-Marne.
Joseph died in 1866 and was succeeded by his son Paul Krug. Joseph had laid the foundations and under the supervision of Paul. By the 1880s the prestige of Krug was acknowledged in the United Kingdom.
After Paul's death in 1910, he was succeeded by his son, Joseph Krug II. However, during World War I Joseph II was taken prisoner and his wife Jeanne played a key role in the House. After the war, Joseph II's slow recovery led to his nephew Jean Seydoux becoming joint manager in 1924.
In 1959 to 1977, Paul Krug II, the son of Joseph II, succeeded his father. His father died in 1967.In 1962 Henri Krug, the son of Paul II, joined the management, as did his brother Remi three years later. In January 1999 the House became part of LVMH[^1] and by 2007. In 2009 Olivier Krug, the son of Henri, became House director.

### 2. Objective

Blending[^2]:

1. Create an algorithm that make use of several tanks to blend different varities of wines and comes out with the desired flavor.
2. Implement a user interface that allows the user to input information on the different wines as well as specify the desired flavor profile for the blended wine, and displays the resulting blend and flavor profile.

Krug Champagne need this software to be able to output steps to mix which wines in which tanks in the least amount of steps in order to have the desired flavor. To have a good result, the following steps under must be taken in to consideration.

### 4. Use case

Description: This use case describes the process of blending different wines to create a new wine blend.

| Name  | Actors | Preconditions | Flow of Events | Assumptions | Notes |
|-------| --------- | --------------- |---------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| Sam Keveth | <b>Manager:</b> Oversees the winery operations and decision-making processes. | 1. The manager has a comprehensive understanding of winemaking processes, including blending techniques. 2. The winery has a range of wines available for blending. | 1. The manager reviews the winery's production plan and identifies the need for wine blending. 2. The manager collaborates with the winemaker and tasting panel to define the blending goals and criteria. 3. The manager oversees the winemaker's selection of base wines, taking into account their characteristics, quality, and potential for blending. 4. The manager approves the proposed blend or provides feedback for adjustments and iterations. 5. The manager monitors the progress of the blending step, reviewing blending records, and ensuring consistency and accuracy. 6. The manager may conduct sensory evaluations and tasting sessions to validate the final blend's quality and alignment with established criteria. | 1. The manager possesses the necessary expertise and decision-making authority to guide the blending process. 2. The manager maintains effective communication and collaboration with the winemaker, tasting panel, and other relevant personnel. | The responsibilities and level of involvement of the manager in the blending step may vary based on winery size, organizational structure, and the manager's role within the winery |
| Zenna Cold | <b>Winemaker:</b> Responsible for overseeing the blending process. | The winemaker has access to the inventory of wines available for blending. | 1. The winemaker selects the desired wines for blending from the available inventory. 2. The winemaker determines the desired proportions for each wine in the blend. 3. The system prompts the winemaker to input the proportions for each selected wine. 4.The winemaker enters the proportions for each wine and submits the blend request. 5. The system calculates the final blend based on the specified proportions. 6. The winemaker reviews and validates the final blend report. 7. If the winemaker is not satisfied, the process returns to step 2 to adjust the proportions or select different wines for blending. | The winemaker has appropriate access rights and permissions to perform the blending process. | The blend proportions can be expressed as percentages, ratios, or specific measurements depending on the winemaker's preference and the system's implementation |
|Jackson James| <b>Winemaker assistant:</b> Provide support and assistance to the winemaker in various tasks related to the winemaking process| 1.The wine assistant has knowledge of winemaking processes and techniques. 2. The winery and winemaker have identified specific tasks for the wine assistant to perform. | The wine assistant receives instructions from the winemaker regarding the tasks to be performed.| 1. The wine assistant has the necessary training, knowledge, and physical ability to perform assigned tasks. 2. The winemaker provides clear instructions and supervision to the wine assistant. 3. The wine assistant adheres to safety protocols and follows winery guidelines.| The responsibilities and tasks of a wine assistant may vary depending on the winery's size, operations, and the winemaker's preferences |

### 5. Blending step

 1. Selection: Winemakers carefully choose different wines to create a desired flavor profile.
 2. Trial Blending: Small-scale blending experiments are conducted, combining different wines in varying proportions to find the ideal blend. Tasting and adjustments are made until the desired result is achieved.
  For example:
   (input --> percatage of wine.
   input --> quantity of wine.
   input --> index[^3] of wine.)[^4]

### 6. Functionalities

The system will be used to blend individual batches of wine to create a consistent flavor profile.

The information on the individual wines, and the system will generate a customized blend based on the algorithm and database:

- Add as many wines as you want in the formula.
- Add as many tanks as you want.
- Tanks should be full or empty, no in-between.
- The error margin.

### 7. User interface

The programmes will be running on both Windows and MacOS, more precisely on a GUI[^5].For example:

1. Representation: There is menu option with the wines number and quantity, and on the other side we have a graph with positive vertices(X, Y), Y represent the quantity/percentage of wines, and X represent the number of each wine.  

2. Menu option: A menu option of several types of wines and quantity/percentage will be presented for the blending process:

- **1. Please enter the quantity/percentage of each wine**
- **2. Start new blend**
- **3. Display the blend result**
- **4. Exit**

1. Input prompts: The user enters the quantity/percentage of the desired number of wines to be blend.

2. Process: After entering the quantity of the different wines, and start the calculation, the position number of each wine with its input quantity/percentage will be graphically represented.

3. Output display: After each blend, display relevant information or results to the user. For example, display the final blend, or any relevant notifications or messages like the total percentage of the blend result.

### 8. Evaluation criteria

Here are the criteria that will be used to evaluate the robustness and consistency of the software:

1. Correctness: no crash, no half full or half empty tanks
2. How close your final product is from the input formula
3. Comments and idiomatic style
4. Minimum number of steps to get to the result
5. Speed of the code

### 9. Conclusion

Overall, the goal of the project is to create a system that can produce high-quality blended wines with a consistent flavor profile, while also allowing for customization and flexibility based on user input.
