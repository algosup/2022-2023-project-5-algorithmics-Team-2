### 1. Introduction

The software will assist the Cellar Master and their team in blending the different still wines to create a consistent flavor profile. The software will optimize the blending process to ensure that the final product is as close as possible to the desired formula either using the minimum number of steps or make use of a long path way and without lasting for too long.
In order to achieve the satisfactory mix, tanks will be used to mix different wines with the requirement that tanks should be either full or empty, no in-between.

### 2. Objective

Blending[^1]:

1. Create an algorithm that make use of several tanks to blend different varities of wines and comes out with the desired flavor.
2. Implement a user interface that allows the user to input information on the different wines as well as specify the desired number of tanks for the blending process, and displays the resulting blend.

This software to be able to output steps to mix which wines in which tanks in the least amount of steps in order to have the desired flavor. To have a good result, the following steps under must be taken in to consideration(Blending step).

### 5. Blending step

 1. Selection: Winemakers carefully choose different wines to create a desired flavor profile.
 2. Trial Blending: Small-scale blending experiments are conducted, combining different wines in varying proportions to find the ideal blend. Tasting and adjustments are made until the desired result is achieved.
  For example:
   
   - (input --> Quantity of tanks to be used.
   - input --> index[^2] of wine. 
   - input --> percentage or quantity of wine.)[^3]

### 6. Functionalities

The system will be used to blend individual batches of wine to create a consistent flavor profile.

The information on the individual wines, and the system will generate a customized blend based on the algorithm and database:

- Add as many wines as you want in the formula.
- Add as many tanks as you want.
- Tanks should be full or empty, no in-between.
- The error margin.

### 7. Interface
The software program will run on a window console.[^4]
1. Text option: The program will run as a text file where the following information will be displayed.

- *1. Please enter the quantity/percentage of each wine*
- *2. Start new blend*
- *3. Display the blend result*
- *4. Exit*

2. Input prompts: The user enters the quantity/percentage of the desired number of wines to be blend.

3. Process: After entering the quantity of the different wines, and start the calculation, the process will take a good ammount of time before displaying the result.

4. Output display: After each blend, display relevant information and results to the user. For example, display the final blend result, and any relevant notifications or messages like the total percentage of the blend result, the similarities, that is, how close in percentage our final result is from the users input formula, the number of steps[^5], and finally the time of operation of the overall process.

### 8. Evaluation criteria

Here are the criteria that will be used to evaluate the robustness and consistency of the software:

1. Correctness: no crash, no half full or half empty tanks
2. How close your final product is from the input formula
3. Comments and idiomatic style
4. Minimum number of steps to get to the result
5. Speed of the code

### 9. Conclusion

Overall, the goal of the project is to create a system that can produce high-quality blended wines based on users input.
